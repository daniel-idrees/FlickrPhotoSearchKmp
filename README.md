This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Desktop (JVM) that has an image search function which enables users to search images and keep a track of runtime searches.

This project serves as a KMP playground to explore Compose Multiplatform (CMP), shared ViewModels, and multi-platform UI development.

#### Features

Search Functionality – Users enter a query, and the app fetches related images.
Search History – A list of previous searches is maintained during the app's runtime. User can also delete the search history.
Image Display – The app shows search results in a scrollable list.
State Management – Search history may reset when the app is restarted

#### Data Source

The App uses [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) to retrieve photos and relatable information

#### API key

Ensure that your project's ```local.properties``` file contains the Flickr API key, like this:

```API_KEY="your_api_key_here"```



* [/composeApp](./composeApp/src) is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - [commonMain](./composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code that’s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    the [iosMain](./composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin) folder would be the right place for such calls.
    Similarly, if you want to edit the Desktop (JVM) specific part, the [jvmMain](./composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin)
    folder is the appropriate location.

* [/iosApp](./iosApp/iosApp) contains iOS applications. Even if you’re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

### Build and Run Android Application

To build and run the development version of the Android app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or build it directly from the terminal:
- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```

### Build and Run Desktop (JVM) Application

To build and run the development version of the desktop app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:
- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:run
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:run
  ```

### Build and Run iOS Application

To build and run the development version of the iOS app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or open the [/iosApp](./iosApp) directory in Xcode and run it from there.
